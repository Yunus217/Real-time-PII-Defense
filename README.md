Real-time PII Defense

This repository contains a redacted dataset designed for exploring methods of real-time Personally Identifiable Information (PII) detection and defense.

The goal of this project is to provide a safe and anonymized dataset that can be used for:

ðŸ”’ Testing PII detection models (e.g., names, emails, phone numbers, credit card numbers).

âš¡ Building real-time PII redaction pipelines for applications such as chat systems, databases, and customer support.

ðŸ›¡ Demonstrating privacy-preserving techniques while ensuring sensitive data is not exposed.

ðŸ“‚ Dataset

File: iscp_pii_dataset_-_Sheet1_redacted_mohammed_yunus.csv

Contents: Sample text entries with PII elements that have been redacted/anonymized.

Purpose: Safe testing of PII defense systems without exposing real sensitive data.
